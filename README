Kraknet News
------------

This is a Kraknet module for news or blogposting, with support for an
unlimited number of separate databases with unique names.

--

To install, clone this repository into the mods/ directory of your
Kraknet web server (https://github.com/krakissi/kraknet), then build the
tools by invoking `make`.

A db/ directory will be created automatically. This is where all stories
are stored. The default database is simply db/s/.

--

To create a new post, make a new text file in the appropriate database
directory. The name of the file should be the Unix time in seconds that
the post should appear to have been created. You can get the current
time by invoking `date +%s`.

The post has a header section and a body section, separated by an empty
line. For example:

[file named 1597124603]
title = My Breaking News Story

<div>
  <p>
    ... critical information ...
  </p>
</div>

[end of file]

Possible header values are:
  title: The title which will appear on your story post. This is
  required.

  hidden: If true, the post will only be accessible by its URL.

You can insert one line with four exclamation marks anywhere in the body
of a story post to create a page break. Content before the break will
appear if the story is shown in a list of stories. Content after the
break will appear only if the story is being displayed by itself
(through the direct link to that particular story). If the story has a
page break, a "Read More..." link will be shown.

For example:

<div>
  <p>
    ... something teasing the story ...
  </p>
</div>
!!!!
<div>
  <p>
    ... the main story, after clicking "Read More..."
  </p>
</div>

Scripts in this module:
  news:cat [db_name]
	- Renders news stories. If there is a s= parameter in the query
	  string, it will render the story matching the specified time.
	  Otherwise, a selection of stories in reverse chronological order
	  are shown. Optionally specify a database name. For example, if
	  your stories are in db/my_news you would invoke
	  `<????news:cat my_news>`.

  news:nav [db_name]
	- Renders navigation links to move to older or newer posts.
	  Optionally specify a database name, as described in news:cat.
